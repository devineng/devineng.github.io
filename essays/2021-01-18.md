**I'm originally a bioengineer. Why the heck am I studying software engineering?** Well, knowing to code is one aspect of bioengineering if you want to create medical devices or engage in research. In my undergraduate education, I learned various engineering disciplines, however, not in depth. As I worked on numerous medical device prototypes, I realized that electrical engineering and coding skills were necessary to develop these devices and that my lack of knowledge in these fields hindered my contributions. I wanted to increase my knowledge of these fields, so I am pursing my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering and taking courses in electrical engineering and computer science.

**The skills I hope to improve in my computer science classes** are critical-thinking, problem-solving, ability to code and learn efficiently, and knowledge of different languages. I look forward to learning Javascript, Meteor, React, and IntelliJ later on in this course. I have some experience with IntelliJ, but I want to become more proficient at it. Taking computer science classes will give me the opportunities to struggle, learn, and practice the skills I need to become a better engineer that's more equipped to develop devices on a team that help people in my community.

**In the future**, I hope to take the skills I develop and use them to code applications that support people's lives in some form. To achieve this goal, I need to obtain more software engineering experience, so I am working my current job and seeking internships for the upcoming 2022 summer.
