**Overview** \
The landscape in Hawaii is always changing. Rain carves the Earth, humans walk on it, and natural disasters occur. Such events can affect hiking trail conditions. \

The problem: People wanting to go on hikes in Hawaii will find that there is no easy way to find out current trail conditions. A hiker knowing beforehand what to expect allows them to prepare accordingly, reducing their risk of uneventful encounters. \

The solution: The Hawaii Hiking Corner application allows people to post trip reports regarding their recent hike for other interested hikers to view. Specifically, the trip report will contain keywords such as the duration and trail conditions, the date hiked, feature to upload photos, and a writing section for additional details about the trail. Additionally, trail information, such as length, location, and elevation, will be provided, so an interested hiker can obtain all the knowledge they need beforehand from this application. Hikers can also login and bookmark trails they are interested in.

**Approach** \
There will be numerous landing pages, one for each trail, and a home page listing the hikes available in a profile-like manner. 
Users can add hikes they are interested into a list and post trip reports. The user home page is the list of interested hikes.
Admins can modify existing hiking pages to reflect current conditions. \

Mockup page ideas:
- Home landing page
- Pages for different hikes
- User home page
- Admin home page \

**Use case ideas** \
New user goes to landing page, can see list of hikes and navigates to different pages
New user goes to landing page, creates a profile, undergoes tutorial of application
User goes to landing page, logs in, can create a trip report or bookmark a hike theyâ€™re interested in. They can also navigate to different pages
Admin goes to landing page, logs in, can modify the content of hiking pages

**Beyond the basics** \
Support an interactive maps feature showing the trail
Trip reports add up, so have a feature that can navigate the trip reports without reloading the page
